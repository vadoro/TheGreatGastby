# Network Analysis of the Narrator and Characters in Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby*

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research paper **"Network Analysis of the Narrator and Characters in Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby***." This repository provides the data, materials, and Python codes associated with the study. 

## Overview

This study investigates a new perspective in literary network analysis by going beyond the traditional focus on character interactions as monolithic social units. While previous research, as surveyed by Vincent Labatut and Xavier Bost, and followed by Korean scholars (Won 2023; H. Kim 2024), has focused on extracting social networks of characters through their co-occurrences, conversations, mentions, actions, and affiliations, this approach tends to reduce narrative complexity. Characters are often treated as singular social agents, limiting the nuances of their portrayal.

Building on previous work—specifically, **"Character as a Web of Words: Towards a Network Theory of Narrative" (2024)**—this study proposes conceptualizing both characters and the narrator as lexical networks of words, rather than as indivisible units. By extracting networks from both dialogues and narrations, we can reveal multi-dimensional layers of narrative voices and character portrayals.

**Why the Narrator?**  
While non-dramatic narratives such as novels feature abundant narration, conventional network analysis largely overlooks the narrator's role. Typically, the narrator is considered as a single, unitary character node, a view that fails to capture the complexity of narrative voice. By representing the narrator as a network of words derived from its narrations—rather than as a solitary “I”—we can illuminate the narrative perspective’s role in shaping character interpretation and thematic resonance.

**Case Study: *The Great Gatsby***  
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* (1925) serves as an exemplary text for demonstrating this approach. In a first-person narrative context, the narrator’s lexical network and the character’s lexical network can be compared and contrasted. By examining ego networks, shared words, and bipartite connections, this study offers innovative insights into how the narrator constructs and interprets characters. The analysis reveals hidden dimensions of a character’s traits and the narrator’s interpretive strategies, ultimately moving towards a richer, multi-layered network theory of narrative.

## Repository Structure

- **datasets**: Contains the raw textual data and processed datasets used for the lexical network analysis.  
- **code**: Includes Python scripts for text processing, network extraction, and analysis.  
- **gephi**: Contains Gephi project files for visualizing and exploring the lexical networks of both narrator and characters.  
- **graphs**: Features visualizations, such as ego networks and bipartite graphs, representing the narrator’s and characters’ lexical networks.  

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the materials provided:

1. **Data Inspection**: Start with the `datasets` folder to review the textual datasets and understand their formatting.  
2. **Network Construction**: Use the scripts in the `code` folder to replicate the cooccurrence network extraction methods.  
3. **Visualization**: Load the `.gephi` files from the `gephi` folder into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to visualize and interactively explore the lexical networks of the narrator and characters.  
4. **Reference Graphs**: Consult the `graphs` folder to quickly access pre-generated network visualizations.

### Prerequisites

- **Gephi**: For network visualization and interactive exploration.  
- **Python**

## Usage

- **Replication**: Run the scripts in `code` to replicate the extraction and analysis steps.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters in the scripts to conduct customized analyses.
- **Comparative Studies**: Use the methods and approaches here as a template for analyzing other first-person narratives or expanding to different corpora.

By positioning both the narrator and characters as lexical networks of words, this study aims to refine the methodological foundations of literary network analysis. I hope this repository serves as a starting point for researchers, students, and enthusiasts eager to deepen their understanding of narrative complexities in literary studies.

Happy researching!
